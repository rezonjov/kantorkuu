## 1. Admin Management
 
There are several types of administrative privilege that can be set to your staff accounts, such as:

 - **Front Desk**:  Create accounts with the Front Desk privilege to allow your staff to access the Reception portal. 
 - **Marketing**: Account with Marketing privilege, will be able to access only the Admin Portal with limited management menu available. Available menu: Member Management and Organization Management. 
 - **Finance**: Finance privilege works the same with Marketing, only with different accessible management menu, such are: Invoice Management, Payment Management, and Reporting.
 
## 2. Member Management
This management menu will allow you to see the listing for all of your members and guests. You can also add a new member and guest with the Add button, and if you go to the detail page, every information related to the member/guest will be listed in detail, including the subscriptions, invoices, payments, and work/visit history. 
 - **Reset Password** button is available to send a change password email to the member if needed. 
 - **Edit Detail** button is available on member detail page to enable you to update the member detail. 
 - **Convert to Member** button is available on guest detail page to enable you to convert the guest into a member.  

## 3. Organizations
Go to this menu to register a new organization or company in the system. Click on the Add Organization button to add a new organization, fill in the form and fields marked with the asterisk are required. 

Notice that you will be asked to input the Organization Owner. When you click on the field, it will show you a list of selection. You can actually the owner name to filter the selection accordingly. For instance, it means **you have to register the owner as a member before you add can a new organization**. 

The Employee Number field is not required to be filled in because later in the organization detail page you can add members to the organization as many as needed or the owners themselves can later invite members to join their organizations through Member Portal. Thus, the Employee Number data is only for your reference and won't have any dependency on the system. Although, **to add new member to the organization, the member must be first registered as your member first**, it works the same when adding the Organization Owner. But when owners invite new members to the organization by sending invitation emails via Member Portal, the unregistered member will be directed to sign up as a member. 

Finally, you can check all the information related to the organization—invoices, payments, subscriptions—on the detail page. You can also upload important documents of the organizations to the portal to serve as future references. 


## 4. Membership Plans
Manage all your for-sale membership plans in this menu. You can add a new plan, activate or disable the item status to display or hide the item from the Reception Portal. 

Click on the Add Plan button to add a new plan, and fill in the new plan form. Notice that there is an input field asking for Room. Leave blank if the subscription does not have any association to any of your private room, but if it does, select an available room to set the association. **If the intended Room is not listed, it means it has been associated with another subscription or the room has not been registered in the system. You need to go to Private Rooms  menu to add the room to the system first and then get back to adding the new plan.** 

Once the plan is created, you can access the detail page and update the detail with the Edit Detail button. Not all of the previously set data can be updated as it may result in data inconsistency in the reporting system. So if there's an important need to update something that is not supported to be edited, you can simply create a new plan and don't forget to disable the previous one so it won't be displayed in your Reception Portal. 


## 5. Membership Items
This menu works quite the same with Membership Plans management menu. This menu will direct you to a page with a list of all your for-sale items. You can add new item and manage existing items, activate or disable item to display or hide the item from Reception Portal. 

Click on the Add Item button to start adding new item and there are several items type to choose:

 - Printing
 - Event 
 - Food & Beverages
 - Other
 - Meeting Room

All those item types once added and while the status is Active, will be displayed in the Membership Item menu in Reception Portal, so they all will be available for purchase. All item type, except for Meeting Room item since it will be available in the Room Booking menu and only for this item type you will have to set price for members and non-members.



## 6. Private Rooms

Private Rooms menu will display a list of all your private rooms available at your location. You can register your rooms here and keep tracks on the availability and the occupant information. 


## 7. Subscriptions
This menu will list all the purchased subscriptions. You can sort the list with the table header—simply click on the desired column. 

Navigate to the detail page to retrieve detailed information of the subscriptions, including the list related invoices. You can also suspend or re-activate the subscription manually if required. 

Aside from the manually update, a subscription status can automatically become Suspended as well when related invoice is voided. 


## 8. Room Bookings
A list of created bookings that you can filter based on the Room. The list will list all past bookings as well as upcoming bookings. Created booking cannot be canceled, except when there was an invoice being generated and the invoice has expired or passed its due date. In that case, the related booking will automatically get deleted from system's booking calendar. 


## 9. Invoices
The Invoices menu will direct you to the invoice management page. The page displays a list of invoices. You can sort the list with the table header or search for a specific invoice with the provided search feature. 

Click on the Detail button to go to the detail page. In the detail page, you can retrieve detailed information on the invoices, including the purchase detail, and all the payment ever made to complete the invoice—since multiple payments may happen for a single invoice, this will help you to track down the payment activity. 

Just below the purchase detail, there is a Void Transaction section where a button is available for you to void the invoice. It is important to note that the void action is irreversible. Once you void the invoice, related payments, and subscription—if any, will be updated accordingly and you can't undo this action. 

You can also access the detail page to add payments to the invoice. There are four payment options available from this page:
 - Pay with Cash
 - Pay with Debit Card
 - Pay with Credit Card
 - Bank Transfer

The first three payment options are available in Reception portal and the staff with Front Desk privilege is supposed to be in charge of the tasks to add payment with those three payment options. 

On the other hand, the Bank Transfer payment option is only available in the Admin Portal since to input the payment with this option, you will have to manually check your bank account and ensure that the payment has been made before inputting the payment to the system. 

Other notable features like Print Invoice and Send to Email are also available for your usage.

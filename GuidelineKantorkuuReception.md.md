*(Image 3. Guest Detail Page)*

**3.1. Check-In / Out** 

This menu will be displayed on a Member's detail page where the member has at least one active subscription. If a member has more than one active subscription from different organizations, a dialog with available subscription options will show up and you will have to choose to check-in the user on behalf of which organization or as the users themselves.

*(Image 4. Select to check-in as)*

The Check-In Limit Remaining is indicating the number of check-ins allowed for a specific user/organization. This option would probably show up when a member purchased a personal subscription but then also registered as one of the organization members with private room subscription which has a number of check-in limit depending on the room capacity. 


**3.2. Guest Check-In / Out** 

Guest Check-In / Out menu will be displayed when:

 - User is a member who doesn't have any active subscription

*(Image 5. Select whom to visit)*

**3.3. Account Statement** 

In this menu, you can check on the user's transaction history. A list of invoices represents the purchase activity and a list of payments represents the payment activity. 

 **3.3.1. Filter Transaction**
	
Use the filter feature to filter the transaction based on the transaction date.

**3.3.2. Table Sort**

Click on the table header to sort the transaction based on its transaction date, invoice number, due date, amount, or status.

**3.3.3. Invoice / Payment Detail**   

Click on the detail button to check the invoice/payment detail. 

**3.3.4. Invoice Detail**

Displaying the purchase detail, and payment history for the invoice (if any). You can take action to resend the detail to user's email or print out the detail. Please make sure you are connected to a printer to do so and set the printer option with A4 paper size. 

For the invoice with UNPAID status, a payment action can be taken with the highlighted button. There are three payment methods that can be chosen from.
- **Pay with Cash**: when this option is chosen, you will have to input the payment amount manually. Please note that the number you input must be the exact amount of the invoice at maximum or could be less than that to support partial payment feature. One invoice can be paid with multiple payments and multiple receipts will be generated accordingly.

- **Pay with Debit Card**: This option does not support partial payment feature. It is a one-time transaction to complete payment of an invoice. When a user wants to make payment with this option, you can set the EDC machine and complete the transaction accordingly. The system is not connected to the EDC machine by any means, meaning you will have to input the transaction into the system manually to update related invoice's status. 
You will be asked to input the Card Number and Approval Code shown upon completing the transaction with EDC machine. 

- **Pay with Credit Card**: This option works the same with Pay with Debit Card option. You will be asked to input the Card Number and Approval Code. 

- Note: As for current version, a user can also make payment with Bank Transfer, but to input the transaction into the system, you will need an Admin to access the Admin Portal and update related transaction accordingly since it requires manual confirmation on your bank account. 

**3.3.5. Payment Detail**

Payment detail shows the detail of payment transaction. Once payment is made, an email containing the transaction detail will also be sent to the user. But just in case, you can resend the receipt and print out the receipt from the payment detail dialog as well. 


**3.4. Room Booking** 

Clicking on Room Booking menu will take you to the room booking management page. You will be shown a day calendar with available room columns. If a specific time span was already booked, it will be displayed in a colorful block. There are three options for the calendar view: Day, Week, Month for you to choose to navigate between dates easily.  

To start creating a room booking, hold click on the time row or click on a specific date, and a booking form dialog will show up. Adjust the booking detail on the form and make sure you enter the right details.

In general, both types of user can book a room. While members may have Meeting Hour Quota from their subscription plan, when a guest creates a booking, the system will calculate the pricing based on the room's hourly rate for non-member. If a member apparently does not have any Meeting Hour Quota available or the quota remaining is not enough to cover a new booking, the system will multiply the excess hour with the room's hourly rate for member. 

Important notes that you might have to put in your booking policy:

 - Booking created with available Meeting Hour Quota can not be canceled. Whether or not the user actually used the room, the used up quota for the booking can't be reverted back. But depending on the member's subscription, the quota may get reset once the subscription hits its recurring period. 
 - Booking created with hourly rate calculation—with invoice generated automatically—can not be canceled as well. On the note that if the invoice expired or has passed its due date, the booking will be deleted from the booking calendar automatically. 

**3.5. Membership Items** 

This menu is accessible by both types of users. There are several types of item that can be purchased from here, such are:
- Food and Beverages
- Printing
- Event
- Other


They are basically any kind of items that are available for sale for member and guest. 

To start creating a purchase, simply click on the desired item to add the item to the cart and then adjust the item quantity. You can also set if the displayed price is tax inclusive or exclusive and set the billing address—if the member belongs to more than one organization, billing address can be set from multiple options. 

Once all has been set accordingly, click on Generate Invoice button to finalize the purchase and generate the invoice. The invoice's due date is set to the date of the purchase transaction by default.


**3.6. Membership Plans** 

Membership Plans menu is listing all the available membership plans. This menu is only available for members. A guest user must be converted into member first before getting the eligibility to purchase a membership plan. 

In a single transaction, only one plan item can be added to the cart. To accommodate a flexible setting for the membership plan, you can adjust the subscription detail before finalizing the purchase by generating the invoice. 

- **Start Date**: The date when the subscription should be active. If the selected subscription includes a private room, the start date by default will be set to the date when the room is available (not occupied). If the selected subscription does not include any private room, then the start date will be set to D+1 of the member's previous subscription's end date. The default date can be adjusted accordingly. 
- **Billing To**: This input field contains multiple options for to whom the invoice should be issued to. Multiple options may available if the member belongs to multiple organization. 
- **Contract Length**: Set the contract length to adjust the subscription duration. The duration will be calculated by multiplying the contract length to the recurring period. For example, if the subscription's recurring period is 30 days, and contract length set to 2, then the duration of the subscription will be 60 days. 
- **Preferred Payment Term**: There are two payment term options: 
	- **Full in advance** which will only create one invoice;
	- **Monthly** which will set the system to generate invoice monthly during the subscription duration. 
- **Discount**: One time discount will apply the discount only once where monthly discount will apply the discount on the monthly invoice. 
- Security Deposit: An amount of security deposit can be added and a separate invoice will be specifically generated. The due date of the deposit invoice can be adjusted with the date picker that show up once you input the deposit amount. By default, the due date is set D-1 of the subscription's start date.
- **Invoice Due Date**: A date picker is provided to set the subscription's invoice due date manually. 
- **Tax Inclusive/Exclusive**: Toggle the button to set whether the base price displayed is tax inclusive or exclusive. 


**3.7. Subscription History**

Displaying a list of the member's subscriptions, including currently active subscription, expired, and suspended subscription. While expired subscription is certainly due to the subscription's end date has passed, many different factors could make a subscription's status to be set as Suspended. 

**3.8. Work History**

Displaying a list of the member's work session to help to track the member's activity at your location. 

**3.9. Visit History**
